# Chicago Participatory Urbanism

Every year, Chicago alders get $1.5 million to spend at their discretion on capital improvements on their ward through the city's Aldermanic Menu Program. Their spending is publicly available in PDF format in the [Chicago Capital Improvement Archive](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/obm/provdrs/cap_improve/svcs/cip-archive.html). We are in the process of extracting and geocoding this data. 

Check out the GitHub issues for things to work on.

# Quickstart

1. Clone the repo.

2. If you have not created an account yet with the City of Chicago Data Portal, sign up for one [at this link](https://data.cityofchicago.org/signup)

3. Once you have created and logged into your account [here](https://data.cityofchicago.org/login), navigate to the developer's settings [at this link](https://data.cityofchicago.org/profile/edit/developer_settings) and select `Create New App Token`. Select an appropriate name like `ward-wise-data-analysis-[YOURNAMEHERE]` and make sure uncheck the `Public?` box.

4. Once the app token and corresponding secret has been generated, create an `.env` file at the root of this repository with this content:
```text
APP_TOKEN=<ENTER_YOUR_APP_TOKEN_HERE>
secret_token=<ENTER_YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN_HERE>
```
>**Note**: do not include the < or > brackets


5. Run the following command in the terminal:
```
make run_ward_spending_scripts run_bikeway_installation_scripts
```
>**Note**: If you are using Windows, you will have to install the **make** command. The easiest way to do this is with Chocolately. Run `choco install make` in an elevated PowerShell terminal. If you get errors running the scripts, trying the command in an admin PowerShell terminal.

The repo has two main parts: the data processing Python package and a library of scripts that use the package. If you're a newcomer, we recommend familiarizing yourself with the project by using the scripts to follow the data processing work flow outlined below.

# Data Processing Work Flow
Using the repo scripts, the data processing involves the following steps:
* Extract data from PDFs
* Post-process data (name cleanup, field seperation, categorization)
* Geocode location data
    * Identify location format
    * Parse location into collection of street numbers or street intersections
    * Get GPS coordinates from street numbers and street interesections
    * Combine coordinates into point(s), lines, or polygons
* Post-process geo-data 
    * Interpolate lines and polygons into point clouds for heatmapping

# Code Overview
## Scripts
* ward_spending_pdf_data_extraction - converts CIP aldermanic menu spending PDFs into CSVs
* ward_spending_post_processing - post-processes PDF data, making fixes to columns and categorizing items
* ward_spending_geocoding - gecodes the CSV data, outputtinga geoJSON
### Upcoming Bike Lanes
* bike_geocoding_script - one-off, uses the ward wise libraries to geocode CDOT upcoming bike lane data

## Chicago Participatory Urbanism libraries
* ward_spending.address_geocoding - use to convert location text into geo-coded geometry data
    * ward_spending.address_format_processing - use to parse location text into street numbers and street intersections
    * geocoder - use to geocode street numbers and street intersections
